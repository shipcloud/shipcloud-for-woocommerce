### Key Features

#### All carriers in a single plugin
shipcloud for WooCommerce empowers you to use all relevant eCommerce shipping carriers from a single interface. No need to copy or upload your order data into another external system (no CSV upload necessary). Stay within your WooCommerce admin panel and work from there.

#### Select "your" shipping carriers
Configure only the shipping carriers you would like to use and leave all the clutter behind.

#### Let your customers choose
We know - everyone has their favorite shipping carrier. And that’s the reason why you should let your customers choose the carrier from within the checkout. Easily add carriers to a shipping zone and define a price you’d like to charge.

#### Bulk Actions
Do you like to work in bulk? Piece of cake! By using our bulk actions you can create and print shipping labels for multiple orders at the same time as well as requesting pickup by the carrier.

#### International shipping
eCommerce has become a global phenomenon. shipcloud for WooCommerce enables you to send cross-border shipments without any hassle. Customs declaration documents will be generated for you so you can send shipments to Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and many more (cross-border) destinations.

#### Shipment tracking for you and your customers
Shipments within shipcloud for WooCommerce get updated once their status has changed at the carrier. This way you always know where your shipments are. And you can let your customers see this too. By displaying the tracking information for their orders you won’t have to send them to a separate tracking page by the carrier. Instead, you keep them within your store.

### Added benefits of using shipcloud

#### Optimized shipping costs
Use attractive shipcloud shipping rates for DHL, UPS, and DPD, or integrate your own carrier contracts. This way you can always choose the most economical service and optimize your shipping costs.

#### Simplify returns management
Creating a returns shipping label through shipcloud for WooCommerce is as easy as cake. Just select the service “returns” when creating a shipping label. Or you could send your customers to your individualized returns portal. Both options are possible with shipcloud. You can even decide to provide the returns shipping label either as a PDF file or a QR code.
