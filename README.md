### Key Features

#### All carriers in a single plugin
shipcloud for WooCommerce enables you to use all relevant eCommerce shipping carriers from a single interface. No need to copy or upload your order data into another external system (no CSV upload necessary). Stay within your WooCommerce admin panel and work from there.

#### Select "your" shipping carriers
Configure only the shipping carriers you would like to use and simplify your process.

#### Optimized shipping costs
Use attractive shipcloud shipping rates for DHL, UPS, and DPD, or integrate your own carrier contracts. This way you can always choose the best service and optimize your shipping costs.

#### Let your customers choose
Let your customers choose their favorite carrier and carrier options in the checkout process. Easily add carriers to a shipping zone and define the options such as green labels and price you would like to charge.

#### Bulk Actions
By using bulk actions, you can create and print shipping labels for multiple orders at the same time as well as requesting pickup by the carrier.

#### International shipping
shipcloud for WooCommerce enables you to send cross-border shipments without any hassle. Customs declaration documents will be generated for you so you can send shipments to Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and many more (cross-border) destinations.

#### Always know where your shipments are
Increase customer satisfaction thanks to multi-carrier-tracking, individual tracking pages and automated notification e-mails in your store design.

#### Simplify returns management
Creating a return shipping label through shipcloud for WooCommerce is very easy.
